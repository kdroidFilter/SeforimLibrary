# Contributing to SeforimLibrary

Thanks for your interest in contributing! SeforimLibrary is part of
[Zayit](https://github.com/kdroidFilter/Zayit) and follows the same rules, which
keep the project clean and legally clear.

## License of your contributions (inbound = outbound)

SeforimLibrary, like Zayit, is licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3** together with the **additional
attribution term** under Section 7(b) of that license (the "Powered by the
technologies that drive Zayit — https://zayitapp.com/" requirement). See
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the full text.

By submitting a contribution (pull request, patch, or any other form), you agree
that your contribution is licensed under the same terms as the project, namely
the GNU AGPL v3 **and** the additional attribution term under Section 7(b), and
under the Contributor License Agreement below.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Zayit is **open core** (see "Open core" in
[Zayit's README](https://github.com/kdroidFilter/Zayit#open-core)): its core,
SeforimLibrary included, is free under the AGPL v3, and its official builds also
include proprietary modules, such as the smart siddur. So that your contribution can be part of those builds,
you sign the [Zayit Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) once:

- You **keep the copyright** on your contribution — there is no copyright
  assignment.
- You grant the maintainer a broad license on it, which allows distributing it
  under other terms too (including with proprietary modules), and a patent
  license.

On your first pull request, the CLA bot asks you to sign by commenting:

```
I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
```

Your signature covers all your later pull requests. A CI check blocks a pull
request until all its authors have signed.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Every commit must also be signed off under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). By
signing off, you certify that you wrote the code or otherwise have the right to
submit it under the project's license.

Add a sign-off line to each commit:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The easy way is to use the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your message"
```

To sign off the last commit you forgot to sign:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

A CI check enforces that every commit in a pull request is signed off.

    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
